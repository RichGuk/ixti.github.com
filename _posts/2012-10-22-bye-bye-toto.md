Finally, I have replaced my [toto][1]-based [blog][2] with real monster -
Mr. [Jekyll][3]. Thanks, Tom Preston-Werner AKA mojombo for this awesome
project. So, I hope from now on, blogging will become easier for me. And
I will, once I'll finish some of the outstanding issues with my current
blog setup...

* I need a good categories/tags generation plugin (all existing are not good
  enough for me, so I guess I'll end up writing my own).
* I need to recreate `atom.xml` feed generator.
* Would be awesome to integrate QR code with URL generator from old blog into
  this one.
* Integrate back disquss and move existing threads to the new locations.
* Add `rake new_post`
